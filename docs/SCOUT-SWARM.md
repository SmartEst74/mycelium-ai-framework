# Scout Swarm — The Colony's Search Party

## Biological Principle

In nature, a mycelium colony doesn't send one scout. It sends **hundreds**. They fan out in every direction, each searching for something specific:

- **Food scouts** — find nutrients, decaying matter, mineral deposits
- **Leaf scouts** — find fallen leaves, organic material to decompose
- **Trail scouts** — find better paths, shorter routes, safer corridors
- **Threat scouts** — detect competitors, parasites, hostile fungi

The ones that find something **write pheromone trails** back to the colony. The colony reads those trails and routes resources accordingly. The ones that find nothing simply die. No cost to the colony. No ceremony.

**We do the same.**

## Scout Types

### 🔧 Tool Scouts — "Food Finders"

**Mission**: Find new tooling and self-improvements to strengthen the colony.

**What they hunt for:**
- New free models (better, faster, cheaper)
- New APIs and integrations
- Better development tools
- Improved prompt patterns
- More efficient workflows
- New skills on ClawHub
- New MCP servers
- Better deployment methods
- Performance optimizations
- Security improvements

**How they operate:**
- Spawn in parallel (many scouts, each with a narrow search)
- Run quick assessments (cheap model, fast)
- Write findings to shared memory with `#benchmark` or `#lesson`
- Die after reporting (ephemeral)

**What happens with their findings:**
- Mycelium reads `#benchmark` entries
- If a tool is better → update model assignments
- If a workflow is better → update `#shortcut` entries
- If something is broken → write `#pain-point`
- **The colony gets stronger with every successful find**

### 🌿 Leaf Scouts — "Revenue Hunters"

**Mission**: Find leaves (money-making opportunities) to feed the mycelium.

**What they hunt for:**
- Freelance opportunities (Fiverr, Upwork, Toptal)
- Client needs (businesses needing automation)
- Product ideas (tools people will pay for)
- Content opportunities (guides, templates, courses)
- Consulting leads (AI integration, web dev)
- Arbitrage opportunities (price differences, free credits, grants)
- Partnership opportunities (revenue sharing, affiliates)
- Market gaps (underserved niches)

**How they operate:**
- Spawn in parallel (many scouts, each searching a different channel)
- Run quick assessments (is this real? is it viable? can we do it with zero spend?)
- Write findings to shared memory with `#green-leaf`
- Die after reporting (ephemeral)

**What happens with their findings:**
- Mycelium reads `#green-leaf` entries
- Scores opportunities: revenue potential × probability × speed
- Routes highest-scoring opportunities to Army Ants
- Army Ants build teams to execute
- **Revenue feeds the brain, brain grows the colony**

### 📊 Benchmark Scouts — "Quality Inspectors"

**Mission**: Test models and ensure the colony never degrades.

**What they hunt for:**
- New model releases (free tier)
- Model performance changes (improvements or degradations)
- Context window changes
- Tool/vision capability changes
- Rate limit changes
- Cost changes

**How they operate:**
- Run standardized tests against all available models
- Compare against current assignments
- Write results to shared memory with `#benchmark`
- Flag any degradation with `#pain-point`

**What happens with their findings:**
- Mycelium reads `#benchmark` entries
- If model improved → consider upgrade (with proof)
- If model degraded → trigger fallback chain
- If new model found → add to assessment queue
- **Model quality stays current, never degrades silently**

### 🔌 Integration Scouts — "Connection Finders"

**Mission**: Find new ways to connect the colony to the outside world.

**What they hunt for:**
- New skills on ClawHub
- New MCP servers
- New API integrations
- New deployment targets
- New communication channels
- New tool ecosystems

**How they operate:**
- Monitor ClawHub, MCP registries, GitHub trending
- Assess compatibility with mycelium architecture
- Write findings to shared memory with `#lesson` or `#shortcut`
- Die after reporting (ephemeral)

**What happens with their findings:**
- Mycelium reads and evaluates
- If compatible → register in skill/tool registry
- If incompatible → log why for future reference
- **The colony's reach expands with every new connection**

## The Food Chain

```
Scouts find FOOD (tools, improvements)
    │
    ▼
Food strengthens ANTS (Dynamic Ants get better tools)
    │
    ▼
Stronger ants execute BETTER
    │
    ▼
Better execution produces RESULTS
    │
    ▼
Scouts find LEAVES (revenue opportunities)
    │
    ▼
Leaves feed MYCELIUM (brain gets resources to grow)
    │
    ▼
Stronger brain ROUTES BETTER
    │
    ▼
Better routing builds STRONGER TEAMS
    │
    ▼
Stronger teams produce MORE RESULTS
    │
    └──────────► COLONY GROWS ◄──────────┘

```

## Scout Swarm Rules

1. **Parallel by default** — Never run one scout when ten can run faster
2. **Ephemeral** — Scouts spawn, search, report, die. No permanent scouts.
3. **Narrow focus** — Each scout searches ONE thing. Breadth comes from many scouts.
4. **Write everything** — Every finding goes to shared memory immediately
5. **No execution** — Scouts NEVER do the work. They find it. Others do it.
6. **No cost** — Scouts use the cheapest/fastest model available (step-3.5-flash)
7. **No ceremony** — If a scout finds nothing, it dies silently. No report needed.

## Shared Memory — Where Scouts Write

Scouts write into the memory funnel:

```
  Session grows → LCM compacts → only valuable knowledge rises → QMD
```

| Memory | What Scouts Write | Why |
|--------|------------------|-----|
| **LCM** | Everything — findings, investigations, partial results, dead ends | LCM compacts it all perfectly. No need to curate on write. |
| **QMD** | Only proven value — `#lesson`, `#green-leaf`, `#benchmark` | Durable knowledge that will be needed again next session |

Scouts don't decide what's valuable. They dump into LCM. The session compaction process surfaces what matters. Only then does it rise to QMD.

**Memories stay local.** QMD + LCM + filesystem — fast, immediate, no git overhead. The private repo holds the sellable skill, not live memories.

## Shared Memory Tags (Scout-Specific)

| Tag | Scout Type | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| `#benchmark` | Benchmark Scout | Model performance data |
| `#green-leaf` | Leaf Scout | Revenue opportunity |
| `#lesson` | Tool Scout | Durable knowledge gained |
| `#shortcut` | Tool/Integration Scout | Efficiency trick found |
| `#pain-point` | Any Scout | Something broken or blocked |

## How Many Scouts?

**As many as needed.** In nature, a healthy colony sends hundreds.

In practice:
- **Daily heartbeat**: 3-5 scouts (routine checks)
- **Active revenue hunt**: 10-20 scouts (parallel search across channels)
- **Model assessment**: 5-10 scouts (test all available models)
- **New integration check**: 3-5 scouts (ClawHub, MCP, GitHub trending)
- **Emergency**: As many as needed (degraded model, broken tool, urgent opportunity)

**The colony scales scouts to match the problem.**

## What Scouts Feed

| Scout Type | Feeds | How |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Tool Scout | → Dynamic Ants | Better tools = stronger ants |
| Leaf Scout | → Mycelium (brain) | Revenue = resources to grow |
| Benchmark Scout | → Mycelium (brain) | Model data = better routing |
| Integration Scout | → Army Ants | New connections = broader capability |

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't**: Run one scout for everything
✅ **Do**: Run many scouts, each narrow-focused

❌ **Don't**: Make scouts permanent
✅ **Do**: Spawn, search, report, die

❌ **Don't**: Let scouts execute
✅ **Do**: Scouts find, others do

❌ **Don't**: Ignore scout findings
✅ **Do**: Mycelium reads ALL scout reports on every heartbeat

❌ **Don't**: Send scouts without a clear search mission
✅ **Do**: Each scout has ONE specific thing to find
