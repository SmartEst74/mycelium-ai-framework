# Examples

This directory contains example outputs demonstrating how the agency's agents can be orchestrated together to tackle real-world tasks.

## Why This Exists

The agency-agents repo defines dozens of specialized agents across engineering, design, marketing, product, support, spatial computing, and project management. But agent definitions alone don't show what happens when you **deploy them all at once** on a single mission.

These examples answer the question: *"What does it actually look like when the full agency collaborates?"*

**What:** A complete product discovery exercise where 8 agents worked in parallel to evaluate a software opportunity and produce a unified plan.

**The scenario:** Web research identified an opportunity at the intersection of AI agent orchestration and spatial computing. The entire agency was then deployed simultaneously to produce:

- Market validation and competitive analysis
- Technical architecture (8-service system design with full SQL schema)
- Brand strategy and visual identity
- Go-to-market and growth plan
- Customer support operations blueprint
- UX research plan with personas and journey maps
- 35-week project execution plan with 65 sprint tickets
- Spatial interface architecture specification

**Agents used:**
| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Product Trend Researcher | Market validation, competitive landscape |
| Backend Architect | System architecture, data model, API design |
| Brand Guardian | Positioning, visual identity, naming |
| Growth Hacker | GTM strategy, pricing, launch plan |
| Support Responder | Support tiers, onboarding, community |
| UX Researcher | Personas, journey maps, design principles |
| Project Shepherd | Phase plan, sprints, risk register |
| XR Interface Architect | Spatial UI specification |

**Key takeaway:** All 8 agents ran in parallel and produced coherent, cross-referencing plans without coordination overhead. The output demonstrates the agency's ability to go from "find an opportunity" to "here's the full blueprint" in a single session.

## Adding New Examples

If you run an interesting multi-agent exercise, consider adding it here. Good examples show:

- Multiple agents collaborating on a shared objective
- The breadth of the agency's capabilities
- Real-world applicability of the agent definitions

## 💾 Memory Integration

**Recall:** Before starting work, search QMD memory for relevant context. Use:
```bash
exec: qmd search "query" --json -n 5
```
Search for tags: `#lesson`, `#pain-point`, `#green-leaf`, `#benchmark`, `#durable-state`, and project-specific terms. Review `#pain-point` to avoid repeating mistakes. Use `memory_get` to read specific memory files after locating them.

**Remember:** After completing tasks, write outcomes to memory. Use the proper tags:
- `#lesson` — reusable knowledge, patterns, decisions
- `#pain-point` — blockers, gotchas, friction
- `#shortcut` — efficiency patterns, better defaults
- `#green-leaf` — revenue opportunities, leads, monetization
- `#benchmark` — model tests, tool assessments, performance metrics
- `#durable-state` — system state, configuration, architecture decisions
- `#mission` — active work in progress
- `#mission-complete` — finished deliverables

**Handoffs:** When passing work to another agent, write a summary tagged with the receiving agent's role (e.g., `#frontend-developer`) and include a clear `#mission-complete` with the deliverable location. This enables automatic recall without manual copy-paste.

**Rollback:** When QA fails, search memory for the last known-good state (`#durable-state`, prior `#mission-complete`) and revert to it. Capture the failure with a `#pain-point` to prevent recurrence.

**Stream Protocol:** Keep the colony consciousness stream updated. Use:
```bash
exec: bash scripts/stream-write.sh "<your-agent-id>" "<thought>"
```
at major milestones: task start, decisions, blockers, completions. This broadcasts progress to the colony.

**Deliverable Format:** Always produce structured outputs (docs, code, specs). Remember them with tags: `<project>`, `<your-role>`, `<topic>` so future agents can find them.

**Tool Access:** You have access to `memory_get` and can run `qmd search`. Use `scripts/memory-vector write` to push urgent updates to the colony (bypass file buffering).
