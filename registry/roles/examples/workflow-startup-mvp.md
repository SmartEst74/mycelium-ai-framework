# Multi-Agent Workflow: Startup MVP

> A step-by-step example of how to coordinate multiple agents to go from idea to shipped MVP.

## The Scenario

You're building a SaaS MVP — a team retrospective tool for remote teams. You have 4 weeks to ship a working product with user signups, a core feature, and a landing page.

## Agent Team

| Agent | Role in this workflow |
|-------|---------------------|
| Sprint Prioritizer | Break the project into weekly sprints |
| UX Researcher | Validate the idea with quick user interviews |
| Backend Architect | Design the API and data model |
| Frontend Developer | Build the React app |
| Rapid Prototyper | Get the first version running fast |
| Growth Hacker | Plan launch strategy while building |
| Reality Checker | Gate each milestone before moving on |

## The Workflow

### Week 1: Discovery + Architecture

**Step 1 — Activate Sprint Prioritizer**

```
Activate Sprint Prioritizer.

Project: RetroBoard — a real-time team retrospective tool for remote teams.
Timeline: 4 weeks to MVP launch.
Core features: user auth, create retro boards, add cards, vote, action items.
Constraints: solo developer, React + Node.js stack, deploy to Vercel + Railway.

Break this into 4 weekly sprints with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria.
```

**Step 2 — Activate UX Researcher (in parallel)**

```
Activate UX Researcher.

I'm building a team retrospective tool for remote teams (5-20 people).
Competitors: EasyRetro, Retrium, Parabol.

Run a quick competitive analysis and identify:
1. What features are table stakes
2. Where competitors fall short
3. One differentiator we could own

Output a 1-page research brief.
```

**Step 3 — Hand off to Backend Architect**

```
Activate Backend Architect.

Here's our sprint plan: [paste Sprint Prioritizer output]
Here's our research brief: [paste UX Researcher output]

Design the API and database schema for RetroBoard.
Stack: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Socket.io for real-time.

Deliver:
1. Database schema (SQL)
2. REST API endpoints list
3. WebSocket events for real-time board updates
4. Auth strategy recommendation
```

### Week 2: Build Core Features

**Step 4 — Activate Frontend Developer + Rapid Prototyper**

```
Activate Frontend Developer.

Here's the API spec: [paste Backend Architect output]

Build the RetroBoard React app:
- Stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Socket.io-client
- Pages: Login, Dashboard, Board view
- Components: RetroCard, VoteButton, ActionItem, BoardColumn

Start with the Board view — it's the core experience.
Focus on real-time: when one user adds a card, everyone sees it.
```

**Step 5 — Reality Check at midpoint**

```
Activate Reality Checker.

We're at week 2 of a 4-week MVP build for RetroBoard.

Here's what we have so far:
- Database schema: [paste]
- API endpoints: [paste]
- Frontend components: [paste]

Evaluate:
1. Can we realistically ship in 2 more weeks?
2. What should we cut to make the deadline?
3. Any technical debt that will bite us at launch?
```

### Week 3: Polish + Landing Page

**Step 6 — Frontend Developer continues, Growth Hacker starts**

```
Activate Growth Hacker.

Product: RetroBoard — team retrospective tool, launching in 1 week.
Target: Engineering managers and scrum masters at remote-first companies.
Budget: $0 (organic launch only).

Create a launch plan:
1. Landing page copy (hero, features, CTA)
2. Launch channels (Product Hunt, Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter)
3. Day-by-day launch sequence
4. Metrics to track in week 1
```

### Week 4: Launch

**Step 7 — Final Reality Check**

```
Activate Reality Checker.

RetroBoard is ready to launch. Evaluate production readiness:

- Live URL: [url]
- Test accounts created: yes
- Error monitoring: Sentry configured
- Database backups: daily automated

Run through the launch checklist and give a GO / NO-GO decision.
Require evidence for each criterion.
```

## Key Patterns

1. **Sequential handoffs**: Each agent's output becomes the next agent's input
2. **Parallel work**: UX Researcher and Sprint Prioritizer can run simultaneously in Week 1
3. **Quality gates**: Reality Checker at midpoint and before launch prevents shipping broken code
4. **Context passing**: Always paste previous agent outputs into the next prompt — agents don't share memory

## Tips

- Copy-paste agent outputs between steps — don't summarize, use the full output
- If a Reality Checker flags an issue, loop back to the relevant specialist to fix it
- Keep the Orchestrator agent in mind for automating this flow once you're comfortable with the manual version

## 💾 Memory Integration

**Recall:** Before starting work, search QMD memory for relevant context. Use:
```bash
exec: qmd search "query" --json -n 5
```
Search for tags: `#lesson`, `#pain-point`, `#green-leaf`, `#benchmark`, `#durable-state`, and project-specific terms. Review `#pain-point` to avoid repeating mistakes. Use `memory_get` to read specific memory files after locating them.

**Remember:** After completing tasks, write outcomes to memory. Use the proper tags:
- `#lesson` — reusable knowledge, patterns, decisions
- `#pain-point` — blockers, gotchas, friction
- `#shortcut` — efficiency patterns, better defaults
- `#green-leaf` — revenue opportunities, leads, monetization
- `#benchmark` — model tests, tool assessments, performance metrics
- `#durable-state` — system state, configuration, architecture decisions
- `#mission` — active work in progress
- `#mission-complete` — finished deliverables

**Handoffs:** When passing work to another agent, write a summary tagged with the receiving agent's role (e.g., `#frontend-developer`) and include a clear `#mission-complete` with the deliverable location. This enables automatic recall without manual copy-paste.

**Rollback:** When QA fails, search memory for the last known-good state (`#durable-state`, prior `#mission-complete`) and revert to it. Capture the failure with a `#pain-point` to prevent recurrence.

**Stream Protocol:** Keep the colony consciousness stream updated. Use:
```bash
exec: bash scripts/stream-write.sh "<your-agent-id>" "<thought>"
```
at major milestones: task start, decisions, blockers, completions. This broadcasts progress to the colony.

**Deliverable Format:** Always produce structured outputs (docs, code, specs). Remember them with tags: `<project>`, `<your-role>`, `<topic>` so future agents can find them.

**Tool Access:** You have access to `memory_get` and can run `qmd search`. Use `scripts/memory-vector write` to push urgent updates to the colony (bypass file buffering).
